				"Glyerin, also called glycerol, is a thick, sugary alcohol. It used to come from candlemaking, when candles were made with animal fats. More recently, it comes as a byproduct of making soaps and, even more recently, synthesized from sugar or propylene (which comes from petroleum).",

It is sometimes used as a sweetener to make it so the food that contains it can be called \"low carb\", as the sugary alcohol is technically not a carbohydrate. Other uses include thickening food, controlling moisture, and stabilizing mixtures of oil and water.");
