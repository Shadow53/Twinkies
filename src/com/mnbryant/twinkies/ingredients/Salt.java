				"Salt, also known as sodium chloride (NaCl), comes from rock salt or brine. Rock salt is mined from salt mines (no joke!) that can be anywhere from hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface. The salt is mined in a pattern that leaves solid columns to help support the mine roof. The general process involves undercutting, a process where a flat slot is cut about 10 feet deep into the salt to leave a smooth surface to pick up salt from. Small holes are drilled into the salt and loaded with explosives. After the work shift, the explosives are remotely detonated, releasing hundreds to thousands of tons of salt onto the mine floor. Equipment loads the salt and it is processed to be broken and crushed into various selling sizes.\r\n\r\n"
				+ "Salt is harvested from brine through the processes of solar and vacuum evaporation. The basic idea of each is the same: evaporate the water and leave the salt behind. Solar evaporation uses massive shallow ponds of brine - anywhere from 40 to 200 acres - while vacuum evaporation uses massive vacuum pans, closed structures about three stories high that are under vacuum. They are found in groups of three to five, with each one under greater vacuum than the previous. Being under greater vacuum decreases the air pressure inside the container, which decreases the boiling point of the salt water inside. Hot steam is fed into the first vacuum pan, which sets the water inside boiling, then that steam is fed to the second pan, and so on. Having multiple pans in a row increases energy efficiency by producing more salt per pound of steam.",
				"Salt may or may not be refined by having the impurities removed and possibly having other additives included as well. One common additive is iodine, creating iodized salt. As sodium chloride, it provides the body with electrolytes and helps relax muscles. Many cultures (such as the United States) consume dangerous levels of salt, however. This leads to high blood pressure, which can lead to stroke and heart disease.");
