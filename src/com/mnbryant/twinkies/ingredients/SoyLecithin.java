				"Soy lecithin is collected from the processing of soybean oil. It is gathered from the oil by adding water to it - the lecithin binds to the water - and separating the water from the oil with a centrifuge or steam precipitation.",
				"Soy lecithin is a collection of phospholipids gathered from soybeans. Phospholipids are molecules that are combinations of a glycerol backbone with two fatty acids and a phosphate group attached. The fatty acids are oil soluble (will dissolve in oil) and the phosphate is water soluble (will dissolve in water), which makes phospholipids special: they will dissolve in both oils and water. This helps keep foods with mixtures of water and oil mixed. This includes salad dressings and chocolate. Because of the water bindings, it also helps keep foods moist.");
