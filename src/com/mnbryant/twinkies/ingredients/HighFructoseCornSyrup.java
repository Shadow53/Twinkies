				"A variant of corn syrup that was made by adding an enzyme to standard corn syrup that converts some of the glucose to fructose, a sugar naturally found in fruits. The FDA differentiates this from sucrose in that sucrose is glucose and fructose bonded together, while in HFCS the fructose remains separate from the glucose.",
				"Some health concerns exist about HFCS due to claims that fructose and glucose are metabolized differently by the body, that glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the body, while fructose goes directly to the liver and is converted to fat in a process called lipogenesis. According to Harvard Health, too much fructose also increases bad cholesterol and blood pressure, and can lead to diabetes. The FDA says, in acknowledgement of such studies, that \"We are not aware of any evidence... that there is a difference in safety between foods containing HFCS 42 or HFCS 55 and foods containing similar amounts of other nutritive sweeteners with approximately equal glucose and fructose content...\" neglecting to mention (at least on that page) that many popular consumer products contain unhealthy amounts of fructose, whether in the form of HFCS or other sources.");
