				"Natural thiamine is water soluble and passes out of the body through urination, but thiamine mononitrate is fat soluble and is harder to expel. This can result in side effects due to having too much thiamine in the system, including liver and kidney disease. Also, in 1985 the \"Journal of Nutrition\" that diets with added thiamine mononitrate in rats did not compensate for a thiamine deficiency. Because of this, LiveStrong suggests finding a more natural source of thiamine.");
