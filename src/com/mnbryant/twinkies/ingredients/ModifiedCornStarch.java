				"Corn starches that have been modified (duh) to dissolve quickly. Corn starch is naturally sticky, but loses that attribute when heated and can cause baked products to go stale as well. It gets modified, then, in a number of different ways depending on its use. The starch molecules can be cross-linked, so it can swell with liquid without falling apart. The resultant product is commonly used as a thickener in processed food. Other modifications could involve adding other things to the corn starch to prevent it from causing staleness.",
