                "A sweet syrup made from cornstarch (the middle part of the corn kernel) by putting the cornstarch in a vat with natural enzymes that break it down into simple glucose. The glucose is then heated and turned into syrup. Corn syrups have a combination of glucose, dextrose, fructose, and malt to keep it stable, and comes in multiple shades. Lighter shades of corn syrup are often used in candy-making, as using the syrup prevents crystallization. This way, candies can keep their smooth textures. Darker syrups, on the other hand, are used in baking.",
