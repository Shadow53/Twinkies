				"Tartrazine (also called Yellow 5 in the United States) is an azo food dye (a vivid dye derived from amino acids) that provides a yellow color.",
				"There were many cases of tartrazine sensitivity reported in the 1970s, leading to requirements for azo dyes to be listed on food labels. The US National Library of Medicine by the National Institutes of Health has a paper by DiPalma JR stating that tartrazine-sensitivity is commonly marked by urticaria (hives) and asthma, though less commonly by vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels), purpura (also called blood spots or skin hemorrhages), and contact dermatitis (skin rash). It is unsure of what causes sensitivity, however, and the sensitivity has been called pseudoallergic, meaning it appears to be like an allergy but happens for other reasons.");
