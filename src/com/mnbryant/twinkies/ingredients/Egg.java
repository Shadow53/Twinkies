                "A part of the reproductive process of chickens. What people do not know or care to know is the living conditions that most of these chickens are in when raised for commercial egg-laying. A pullet (female chick that cannot yet lay eggs) is beak-trimmed (anything from dulling the sharp point on the beak to removing a third of the beak at most) during its first week of life, then after 10-15 weeks is moved to a laying facility. When the chickens are in the laying facility, they begin to receive greater amounts of light each day (implying that they are otherwise kept in the dark). The increase in light triggers egg-laying in the chickens. The eggs are laid onto angled floors than roll the eggs onto a nylon conveyor belt. The eggs are then washed, inspected, and graded for packaging before being put into cooler rooms that are between 40 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit to await transport.",
