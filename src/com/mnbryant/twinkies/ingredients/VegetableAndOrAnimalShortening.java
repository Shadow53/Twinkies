				"Vegetable shortening is a flavorless solid fat made from hydrogenated vegetable oils. It is almost completely flavorless and is commonly used in baking to make things like pie crust light and flaky. Crisco is quite possibly the most well-known brand of vegetable shortening. Whatever brand Hostess uses, their vegetable shortening comes from soybean, cottonseed, or canola oils.\nAnimal shortening, on the other hand, is another name for animal fat, commonly lard. According to the ingredients list, the animal shortening used is beef fat.",
				"The hydrogenation process is simply adding hydrogent to an oil, turning it into a solid. Foods containing hydrogenated fat have a longer shelf life than those that do not, so manufacturers encourage their use to provide their foods longer shelf lives. Even if the original oil was considered healthy for use, the hydrogenation process turns it into very NOT healthy trans fats. These fats increase bad cholesterol and the risk of heart disease and stroke, and can also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.");
